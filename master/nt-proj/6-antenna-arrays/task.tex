due June 1st 23:59 LT \\

Simulate the radiation pattern (Array factor) of different antenna array arrangements.\\

1a) 5 x 5 antenna , squared grid, 0.5 lambda wavelength (WL) spacing
for vertical and 60Â° off-vertical beam pointing along one array axis
Plot the resulting radiation pattern in spherical top view (directional cosines) and ONE cross section through the main beam.\\

1b) same as 1a, but for 1.0 and 1.5 WL\\

2) Plot the array geometry and mark the phase distribution for the off-vertical scenario for 0.5 WL and 1.5 WL.\\

3a) same as 1a) but equilateral grid structure , e.g. 19 antennas\\

3b) same as 3a), but for 1.0 and 1.5 WL\\
