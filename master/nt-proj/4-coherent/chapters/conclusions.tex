Coherent and incoherent integrations have been shortly investigated. Coherent integration acts on the complex valued signals and provides a linear SNR gain with increasing numbers of integrations which might be useful in situations where low signal powers are measured or noise is great. The incoherent integration method is simpler and also scales the SNR linearly with the number of integrations. It may be used in cases when the phase information is not needed.
